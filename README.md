# Data Structures – C++
This repository contains university assignments focused on implementing
fundamental data structures from scratch, without using STL containers.

The goal of these projects was to better understand how data structures work
internally, including memory management, iteration and time complexity.
## Implemented data structures
- Bag
- Set
- Map
- Matrix
- SortedMultiMap
Each structure was implemented using dynamic memory allocation and custom
iterators, following the required abstract data types (ADT).
These projects were developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms
course.
